# coding-quiz
This coding quiz was created by combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API's. A basic outline was created in HTML and further variables and elements were added with JavaScript. The items were later styled using CSS id's and classes. Questions were put into an array and then cycled through using a function and if/else statements. The high scores page utilizes a for loop as well as multiple functions. The high scores were stored using local storage.
